The library file kernel_cortex_m4f_keil5.lib is compiled for Cortex-M4F
with FPU by library project:

%kernel_path%/project/cortex_m/kernel_cortex_m_keil5/kernel_cortex_m_keil5.uvprojx

If you need another target (Cortex-M0/M0+/M1/M3/M4/M4F), you should compile it
yourself: in project properties, go to tab Device, and select needed platform
(Cortex-M0, etc)
